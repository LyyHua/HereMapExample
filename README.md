In order to run this you need 3 things. First the HERE api key and HERE secret api key declare in local.properties (stfu that's the only way i know how to hide my shit)

The 2 key is name HERE_API_KEY and HERE_API_SECRET_KEY respectively

And lastly is the aar file you get from HERE sdk

How do i get that you ask ?

Download it from HERE, idk what to tell you man.
